## 🛠️ The Real Fix (Do This Once, Forever Works)

Let’s do what you should’ve been told from the beginning:

### 🔐 Use SSH Instead of HTTPS

You’ll **never** deal with token prompts again. Set it up once, and it’s smooth sailing.

### ⚙️ Step-by-Step (Intern’s Mac):

#### 1. **Generate SSH Key**

Open Terminal:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "intern@example.com"
```

Just hit enter for all prompts (it saves in `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).

#### 2. **Add SSH Key to GitHub**

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Copy the output, go to GitHub > ⚙ Settings > **SSH and GPG Keys** > "New SSH key", paste it, name it “MacBook” or whatever.

#### 3. **Test it Works**

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

If it says “Hi \[username]! You’ve successfully authenticated,” you're golden.

#### 4. **Clone via SSH**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/your-repo.git
```

No password prompt. No tokens. Just works.

## ✅ Now What?

* **Repo cloned?** Open in VS Code (`File > Open Folder`).
* **Make edits.** Save.
* **Stage, commit, push.** Use VS Code Source Control tab or run:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Intern: First edit"
git push
```

## 🤖 Final Opinion

Forget SATs unless you're forced. SSH is the grown-up way. It's stable, invisible once set up, and doesn’t waste anyone’s time. I’m annoyed GitHub didn’t force the *better* method by default.

If your intern sets up SSH, this crap is over—for good.

Want me to generate the key and push instructions as a printed card for your intern? Or inject it into a training repo `README.md`? Say the word—I'll ship it.
