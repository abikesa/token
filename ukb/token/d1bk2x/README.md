On a **Mac Studio with a 27-inch display**, what matters is not the *screen size* but the **browser viewport width** in pixels. That said, assuming a full-screen browser window on a 27" display (2560×1440 or higher), here's what happens **based on your CSS**:

---

### 🧠 Your CSS breakpoint logic:

```css
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .app-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 1fr);
  }
}
```

This means:

* **Any screen width ≥ 1024px** → `grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 1fr)`
* That’s a **hard-coded 5 columns**, regardless of whether the screen could fit 6, 8, or 12.

---

### ✅ So: **You will always see exactly 5 icons per row**, no matter how wide the screen is — even on a Mac Studio with a 6K or 27" display — because you hard-set the desktop layout at:

```css
grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 1fr);
```

---

### 💡 Want true *adaptive* grid on large screens?

If you’d rather let large screens show **more than 5 columns**, use this instead:

```css
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .app-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(140px, 1fr));
  }
}
```

This tells the grid:

> “Fit as many icons as possible across the row, but each should be at least 140px wide.”

That way:

* On a **1024px screen**, maybe 5 icons
* On a **1440px screen**, maybe 7–8
* On a **2560px screen**, maybe 10–12

---

### ✅ Your options:

| CSS setting                            | Behavior on 27" Display                                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `repeat(5, 1fr)`                       | Always shows 5 columns.                                                    |
| `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(140px, 1fr))` | Shows as many columns as fit naturally.                                    |
| `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(...))`       | Similar to `auto-fit`, but fills out gaps differently if items don’t wrap. |

---

Would you like a hybrid mode where:

* You **cap** it at 8 or 10 icons per row?
* Or let it **expand fully**, but with elegant max-width constraints?

I can tune it for any aesthetic you want — minimalist symmetry, maximal info density, or symbolic rhythm.

Great question — these values represent **viewport widths in pixels**, and they're used in your CSS `@media` queries to define **breakpoints** for responsive design. Here's what each one typically maps to in practical device terms:

### 🧭 Breakdown of Common Media Query Widths

| Breakpoint (px)  | Represents (typically)             | Example Devices                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **≥1024px**      | **Desktop / large screens**        | MacBook, iMac, desktop monitors (e.g. 13"–27"+ screens)              |
| **768px–1023px** | **Tablet / small laptops**         | iPads, Surface tablets, smaller laptops (11"–12.5")                  |
| **≤767px**       | **Phones (landscape or portrait)** | Most smartphones (iPhone SE to iPhone 15 Pro, Galaxy S series)       |
| **≤400px**       | **Tiny phones / compact view**     | iPhone SE, Android minis, embedded browsers, or compact iframe views |

### 🔍 What these breakpoints *do* in your CSS

These `@media` queries change the **grid layout** in `.app-grid` like so:

```css
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .app-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 1fr); /* desktop: 5 columns */
  }
}

@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px) {
  .app-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); /* tablet: 3 columns */
  }
}

@media (max-width: 767px) {
  .app-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); /* phone: 2 columns */
  }
}

@media (max-width: 400px) {
  .app-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(1, 1fr); /* tiny screen: 1 column */
  }
}
```

---

### 🧠 Rule of Thumb

* **≥1024px**: Treat this as your **"desktop mode"** breakpoint.
* **768px–1023px**: This is your **"tablet mode"** sweet spot.
* **≤767px**: This triggers **"mobile mode."**
* **≤400px**: For **micro-UI / ultra-compact / safety net** layouts.

### ⚡ Pro Tip

You can also test these live in Chrome:

1. Open DevTools (Right-click > Inspect).
2. Toggle device emulation (Ctrl+Shift+M).
3. Resize the width manually or choose from presets like iPhone, iPad, MacBook.

Want a more fluid design instead of hard cutoffs? I can refactor your layout using `auto-fit` with `minmax()` to gracefully adapt instead of hard-switching.
